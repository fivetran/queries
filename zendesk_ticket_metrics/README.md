using the provided SQL queries, create the following views

   first_response_time
   first_resolution_time
   full_resolution_time
   wait_times

once these views have been created use the view_join_pseudocode.sql to combine them

# note that all queries assume that the schema name is "zendesk", so a rename will be needed if the schema name used is different
