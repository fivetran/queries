using the provided SQL queries, create the following 4 views

   (1) first_response_time, 
   (2) first_resolution_time, 
   (3) full_resolution_time, 
   (4) wait_times

once these views have been created use ticket_metrics.sql to combine them

# note that all queries assume that the schema name is "zendesk", so a rename will be needed if the schema name used is different
